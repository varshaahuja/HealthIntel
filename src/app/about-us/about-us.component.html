            <p>
              Health Intel gives important opportunities for the detection and management of depression in elder. We
              intend to collect data from health insurance companies and share a set of questionnaire to all the people
              aging 60 and above to understand their mental health, and based on the data collected our web application
              decides if the person filing it is under any kind of depression. The questionnaire would be sent every
              four months or earlier based on the person's initial report and the people can be given benefits if they
              fill the questionnaire. It wouldn't directly disclose the purpose of any questions being asked but
              internally based on response the person would be divided under red, green and amber state. Based on the
              reports the person’s emergency contact or the Health Intel services or Health insurance companies can act
              ahead. We distinguish treatment methodologies, for example, estimation based ventured care and community
              oriented consideration that can considerably improve the viability of treatment and we feature open doors
              for tending to wellbeing inconsistencies in geriatric misery care. We will in general also involve the
              significance of sharing and supporting family guardians of discouraged more established grown-ups by
              sorting out different occasions.

                <p>
                  Geriatric depression is seriously undetected, undiagnosed, and undertreated. Several tools are
                  available to facilitate screening for depression. A single-item screening question is the simplest
                  among all screening tools. A very simple question asking the client about their current mood with a
                  simple yes or no had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 89%. Health Intel performs The Patient
                  Health Questionnaire on clients which asks patient about their mood for a longer period of time:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>During the past weeks have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? </li>
                  <li>During the past month have you often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>
                  This questionnaire is useful in identifying patients at high risk for depression, and it has a
                  sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 77%, and a positive predictive value of 14% in older adults.
                  Such brief screening tools can be easily administered by the Health Insurance team and appropriate
                  treatment will be suggested.
                </p>
                <p>Excessively positive reaction to these polls should caution the Health Insurance group or specialist
                  to additionally assess the patient for sadness. Not every discouraged patient will answer decidedly to
                  these surveys, and to address the chance of 'bogus negatives,' the medical coverage group may wish to
                  approach extra inquiries concerning burdensome side effects for patients who seem discouraged, who
                  experience issues taking part in care, or whose utilitarian disability appears to be conflicting with
                  target clinical sickness.</p>

                  A subsequent consideration of how to deal with treatment at first presents patients with moderately
                  basic nonintrusive mediations and takings to a great deal of extraordinary treatment draws near if
                  patients don't appear to be up without a doubt.

                  As the initial phase right now, persistent and steady relatives might be urged to attempt
                  self-coordinated intercessions, for example, wonderful occasions planning, physical, or social
                  exercises. At the point when these endeavors neglect to improve gloom, progressively escalated
                  intercessions can be offered as guided self improvement, which consolidates a self improvement manual
                  with a predetermined number of brief treatment meetings. Increasingly serious psychosocial
                  intercessions would then be able to be offered at the outpatient level, day treatment, and inpatient
                  level if patients don't improve their true form. To encourage such treatment escalation, it is
                  essential to utilize target estimates, for example, the Physical Health Questionnaire to screen
                  burdensome side effects after some time.
